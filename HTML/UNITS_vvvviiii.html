"html tag" inherits its font-size from the settings of the browser.

em*px will give the value in pixel

px: If the value of pixel is not mentioned, it will be inherited from the parent.
    If the value of pixel is mentioned, it will be the pixel value and there will be no inheritance.
em: Whatever is the font-size of the element in px, em will be multiplied to that to give the font-size in pixel.
padding: if padding is given in em, em*font-size of the element in px.

rem: this on the other hand depends only on the font-size of the html tag which depends on the settings of the browser.

%:
When the parents dimensions are automatically decided, make the dimension of the child as "auto", or do not set the dimensions at all.
If u have set the font-size as %, it will be wrt the font-size of the parent.
If u have set the width as %, it will be wrt the width of the parent.


                                      WHEN TO USE WHAT?
px: not affected when the visually impaired changes the font-size of the browser window.(remains constant)
    therefore, use: border(border-size should not be change when the user changes the font settings)
html{
  font-size: "x"px; // never use px here, it will disable the user's size settings on their browser.
  // either do not use any, or use %,em,rem.
}
%: most responsive==used for height,width,padding,margin======especially when parent...parent present.
   // gets disturbing when positon is present on itself or its parent.
