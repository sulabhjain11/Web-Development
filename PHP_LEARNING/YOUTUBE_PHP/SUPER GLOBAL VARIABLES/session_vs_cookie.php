// When we work on an application over the internet, the webserver doesn't know the user because the HTTP protocol does not maintain the state. The information provided by the user on one page of the application (Let's say Home) will not be transferred to another page. To remove this limitation, sessions are used. Session gets started whenever a visitor first enters a website.

// The user information is stored in session variables, and these variables can store any type of value or data type of an Object.

// The user is identified with the help of sessionID, which is a unique number saved inside the server. It is saved as a cookie, form field, or URL.
